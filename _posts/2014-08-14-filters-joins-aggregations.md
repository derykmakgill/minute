title: What Every Data Scientist Needs to Know about SQL
permalink: data-science-sql
---

One of the most important tools required to be a successful data
scientist is relational databases like
[SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).  The majority of data
stored by businesses is in these relational databases. And in
addition, they are exceptionally good at storing complicated business
data sets as well as allowing for efficient information retrieval.
So having a strong understanding of relational databases is essential
to being an effective data scientist.

In this series of posts, I will provide a broad overview of the key
topics required to successfully work with databases to do effective
data science. My hope is to take a breath-first search approach to
teaching by introducing the most important topics first.  Whenever
possible, I will attempt to avoid theory in favor of practicality
with the goal of getting you up to speed as quickly as possible.
